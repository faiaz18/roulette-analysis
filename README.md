# roulette-analysis
The code was part of my matura thesis. I quantified roulette using quantitative analysis. This allowed me to study and develop strategies that would allow me to win with higher probabilities than usual.

The quantitative analysis involved the creation and use of statistical and mathematical models to analyze large data sets, with a focus on implementing these models into code using Python. So the goal was to convert mathematical and statistical models and concepts into code, utilizing the principles of statistics and probability theory to perform quantitative analysis on roulette data. Ultimately, this analysis has yield insights and conclusions about the game of roulette that can be useful for further study or practical application.
